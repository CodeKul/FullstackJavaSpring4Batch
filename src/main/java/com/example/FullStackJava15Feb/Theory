A stored procedure is a set of precompiled SQL statements that are used to perform a special task.

A stored procedure is mainly used to perform certain tasks on a database. For example

1.Get database result sets from some business logic on data.
2.Execute multiple database operations in a single call.
3.Used to migrate data from one table to another table.
4.Can be called for other programming languages, like Java.


Joins => we can combine two or more table and fetch the data from tables.
type of join =>
1. Inner Join -> Return dataset that have matching values in both table
2. Left Join -> Return all record from left table and matching record from right table.
3. Right Join -> Return all record from right table and matching record from left table
4. Full Join -> return all record when there is a match in either left table or right table.


alter table employee add column test varchar(20);
alter table employee rename column salary to employeeSalary;

select * from employee  limit 2;
select * from employee order by salary desc limit 1;
select * from employee order by salary;
select * from employee order by name Asc;
select count(*) as employeeCount from employee;
